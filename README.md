## 📘 About the Book

This guide introduces a practical framework — the **MCP loop (Model → Context → Protocol)** — combined with **Finite State Machines (FSM)** to help developers, educators, and students build adaptive, AI-enhanced systems on the ESP32 microcontroller.

From basic blinking LEDs to advanced sensor-aware AI agents, each project is modular, well-commented, and designed for real-world integration.

## 🧩 What's Inside

- **FSM architecture** for embedded control
- **AI classification** using camera or sensor input
- **Agent logic loops** (Sense → Plan → Act → Log → Repeat)
- Integration of MCP concepts with ESP32 peripherals
- Reusable templates and function-driven coding patterns
