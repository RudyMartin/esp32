## 📘 **Tips, Tricks, and Traps for ESP32 AI Agent Systems**

**Build Smarter Devices with the MCP/FSM Method**

Author: [Rudy Martin](linkedin.com/in/rudymartin)

Unlock the power of intelligent embedded systems with this hands-on guide to designing agent-based applications using the ESP32 and a unique MCP (Model–Context–Protocol) framework. Whether you're an educator, maker, or aspiring engineer, this book teaches you how to build AI-driven systems that think, act, and adapt — all using the familiar power of Finite State Machines (FSM).

From blinking LEDs to real-time decision-making agents, you'll learn how to combine sensors, servos, classification models, and stateful logic into reusable building blocks for edge intelligence.

### 🔧 What You'll Learn:

* ✅ How to implement the **MCP loop** for agent behavior: Sense → Plan → Act → Log → Repeat
* ✅ Design patterns for **FSM-driven decision making** in ESP32-based systems
* ✅ Integration of AI inference, environment sensors, and action routines
* ✅ Tips for debugging, modular design, and performance tuning
* ⚠️ Common **traps** that cause agent logic to fail — and how to avoid them

---

### 🎓 Who It's For:

* Educators building project-based AI/robotics curricula
* Makers and hobbyists interested in smarter microcontroller projects
* Engineering students learning real-world embedded systems design
* Anyone who wants to go beyond "if-else" coding and into agentic thinking

---

**Includes starter code, schematics, and annotated walkthroughs** for 5 labs and 3 capstone-ready AI agents.
