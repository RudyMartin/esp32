Unlock the power of intelligent embedded systems with this hands-on guide to designing AI-powered agents using the ESP32 and a unique **MCP (Model–Context–Protocol)** framework. Whether you're an educator, maker, or engineer, this guide helps you build systems that think, act, and adapt — all through the power of **Finite State Machines (FSM)**.

From blinking LEDs to real-time decision-making agents, you’ll learn to combine sensors, servos, classification models, and logical control into modular, mission-ready designs.

## 🔧 What You’ll Learn

- ✅ Implement the **MCP loop**: Sense → Plan → Act → Log → Repeat  
- ✅ Apply **FSM design patterns** for embedded decision logic  
- ✅ Integrate AI models, sensors, and actuators into intelligent agents  
- ✅ Debug smarter, build modular, and avoid common pitfalls
