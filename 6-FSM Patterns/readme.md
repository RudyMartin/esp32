TODO: REFRESH THIS TO REFLEACT ACTUAL LABS __> Use of **one of 6 key FSM-driven patterns** in your DSAI-MCP-Camp system.

---

Yes! This is a **perfect opportunity** to teach students about **state machines** — in a way that's **visual**, **timed**, and deeply connected to embedded systems.

---

## 🧠 What is a State Machine?

A **state machine** is a programming pattern where a system:

1. **Exists in a defined state**
2. **Transitions between states based on rules or events**

Each state has its own behavior (e.g., blinking an LED), and transitions happen based on time, input, or sensor data.

---

## 📚 Real-Life Analogy

Imagine a **traffic light**:

* 🚦 Red → Green → Yellow → Red
* Each color = a **state**
* Timer = a **trigger to change state**

Or in our case:

* 🔴 Blink phase = "blink state"
* 🔁 Rotate phase = "rotation state"
* Timer = our transition trigger

---

## ✅ Why Teach with This?

* It's **visually clear** (students *see* LEDs change)
* It’s **modular** — easy to expand (add new states!)
* It’s a **core concept** used in real embedded systems, games, UI, robotics, etc.

---

GOAL: Modular State Machine with Config Table
We’ll define each state in a structured config dictionary (or table) that includes:

Duration (optional or zero = manual transition)

Behavior function

Next state (or use conditional logic later)

Then the loop() simply:

Looks up the current state in the table

Runs the state's function

Checks if it's time to transition

Switches to the next state accordingly

| Feature           | Why it helps students                             |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Config-driven     | Students edit a table, not code internals         |
| Named functions   | Easier to organize per behavior                   |
| Extendable        | Add/remove states without touching the loop logic |
| Clear transitions | States define their own "next"                    |





## 👨‍🏫 Lesson Outline Using State Machine

| Time      | Activity                                                                            |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 0–5 min   | Explain state machines (concept + examples)                                         |
| 5–10 min  | Show blinking LED (single state)                                                    |
| 10–15 min | Add rotation phase (multi-state)                                                    |
| 15–25 min | Introduce code with `enum`, `switch`, and transitions                               |
| 25–30 min | Ask: “What other states could we add?” (e.g., pause, error, button-triggered state) |

## 🔧 Code Structure Using a State Machine

We’ll define an `enum` for states, and use a `switch-case` to handle each state:

```cpp
enum State {
  BLINK,
  ROTATE
};

State currentState = BLINK;
```

In `loop()`:

```cpp
switch (currentState) {
  case BLINK:
    // do blinking
    // if 10 seconds passed, currentState = ROTATE
    break;

  case ROTATE:
    // rotate LEDs
    // if 10 seconds passed, currentState = BLINK
    break;
}
```

---

## 🔁 Transitions

* Each state **runs its logic** for 10 seconds using `millis()`
* After time expires, **change the state**
* Console logs: `Serial.println("Switching to ROTATE state");`

---

## 🛠 Bonus Teaching Ideas

* Add a `PAUSE` state triggered by a button
* Add a `SLEEP` state after 1 minute of idle time
* Add a `DEBUG` state that prints extra info
* Use **colored LEDs or motors** to show states physically
