14.1.2.1. I2C communication
I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit) is a two-wire serial communication mode, which can be used to the connection of micro controller and its peripheral equipment. Devices using I2C communication must be connected to the serial data (SDA) line, and serial clock (SCL) line (called I2C bus). Each device has a unique address and can be used as a transmitter or receiver to communicate with devices connected to the bus.

14.1.2.2. MPU6050ÔÉÅ
MPU6050 Sensor Module is a complete 6-axis Motion Tracking Device. It combines a 3-axis Gyroscope, a 3-axis Accelerometer and a DMP (Digital Motion Processor) all in a small package. The settings of the Accelerometer and Gyroscope of MPU6050 can be changed. A precision wide range digital temperature sensor is also integrated to compensate data readings for changes in temperature, and temperature values can also be read. 
The MPU6050 Module follows the I2C communication protocol and the default address is 0x68.
