You can get the `Adafruit_PWMServoDriver.h` library from the Arduino Library Manager. Hereâ€™s how to install it step by step:

---

### âœ… **Install Adafruit PWM Servo Driver Library**

1. **Open Arduino IDE**
2. Go to **`Sketch` â†’ `Include Library` â†’ `Manage Librariesâ€¦`**
3. In the **Library Manager**, type:

   ```
   Adafruit PWM Servo Driver
   ```
4. Look for:

   ```
   Adafruit PWM Servo Driver Library
   Author: Adafruit
   ```
5. Click **Install** (usually installs alongside the required `Adafruit BusIO` dependency).

Let me know if you'd like a test-only `.ino` that confirms the PCA9685 is connected and responsive before mixing in servos or steppers.
