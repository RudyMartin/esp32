## 💬 Lab 1 Focus Recap

### 🧠 What Happens:

**Lab 1** introduces the concept of **intelligent agents** by building a simple **LLM-powered chatbot** that responds to student questions. This lab sets the stage for the MCP loop by modeling “thinking” behavior using generative AI.

| Step       | Role in Lab 1                                             |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Sense**  | Student inputs a question into the chatbot                |
| **Plan**   | LLM processes the input and generates a response          |
| **Act**    | Chatbot prints the response                               |
| **Log**    | Optionally saves or displays previous questions/responses |
| **Repeat** | Waits for the next question and starts over               |

### 🧠 Key Agent Behavior:

* **Language-based interaction**
  → System reacts intelligently to user input
  → Mimics cognition: “understanding” and “responding”

> 🔄 Example:
> Student: “What is a robot?”
> Agent: “A robot is a machine capable of carrying out tasks automatically.”

### 🧰 What Students Build:

* A **simple chatbot interface** (e.g., Python notebook or Streamlit)
* Connect to an **LLM API or local model**
* Use **context-aware prompts** to shape responses
* Explore **chat history**, follow-up questions, and basic memory

---

### 🧠 Learning Goals of Lab 1:

* Understand what an LLM is and how it “thinks”
* Learn the **input → process → output** pattern
* Practice writing questions that produce meaningful answers
* Recognize how **context** changes a model’s behavior

### ✅ Script Name:

```plaintext
lab1_llm_chatbot_intro.ino`* (or `.py` if it’s a notebook)
```

If you used Streamlit or Colab, the main script might be:

```plaintext
lab1_llm_chatbot_app.py
```
